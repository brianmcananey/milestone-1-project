## Design

## Colour Scheme

### Typography

choose font and why---!>

### Imagery

* Imagery is very important to the website as the site needs to show off the area the restaurants are in and be appealing for people toi come and visit.

* The pages will be consistent with the same large hero image displayed over the contents of each page.

### Icons

* I used icons from Font Awesome to encourage users to click on certain buttons and to add a clear visual indicator of where to click.

## Structure

### Information Architecture

  *The website has a Homepage, then 2 further pages; a Where to Eat? page and a Contact page.
    - Homepage - Large hero image with an About section describing the area and purpose of the website.
    - Where to Eat? - Large hero image with 4 sections for 4 different restaurants advertised on the website. Each section will have a description of each restaurant and a link to the actual restaurant website.
    - Contact - Large hero image with a contact form which is displayed alomg with a google map of the area for directions.

### Navigation Bar

* Each page will have the navbar along the top, allowing the user to easily navigate to the different pages.
*The navbar appears as a horizontal list on desktop and a drop down menu on mobile.

* I have used Bootstrap Navigation component <!insert what i have changed and why---!>

### Buttons

* Butttons are consistent in design across the site. The only differnece will be the colour on the Sign Up button.
* Buttons change colour when hovered over. The button text is legible both in its normal and hover state.
* I have used Bootstrap Button classes, which I have customised in CSS.
