# Roker Restaurants

## Milestone Project 1 - Static Frontend Website

/*insert images of website*/

* Roker Restaurants is a website designed to entice new customers to the varying restaurants located on Roker beach near Sunderland.

* This is my Milestone 1 Project submission for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development. My website will consist of 3 pages and is built using technologies and languages I have learned so far on the course, mainly HTML and CSS.

# User Experience

## User Stories

### Prospective Visitors

*These are users who are considering or have already planned a trip to one of the restuarants*

 * As a prospective visitor I would like to see what deals are on offer in each restaurant.
 * As a prospective visitor I would like to see what variaty of food is on offer in each of the restaurants.
 * As a prospective visitor I would like to see what amenities are nearby to the restaurants.

### Typography

### Imagery

* Imagery is very important to the website as the site needs to show off the area the restaurants are in and be appealing for people to come and visit.

* The pages will be consistent with the same large hero image displayed over the contents of 2 pages. They will also have the same navbar and footer.

### Icons

* I used icons from Font Awesome to encourage users to click on certain buttons and to add a clear visual indicator of where to click.

## Structure

### Information Architecture

  * The website has a Homepage, then 2 further pages; a Gallery page and a Sign Up page.
    - Homepage - Large hero image showing a view of the area. It will also show a selection of restuarants in the area with direct links to their own websites which open in seperate tabs. It will also have a section showing what is on in the area and when.
    - Gallery Page - This will show images of different sights of the area, for example, views from the restaurants, local wildlife and upcoming events.
    - Contact - Same large hero image as the homepage but will also have a form on to sign up to a newsletter/discount codes.
  * Most pages feature buttons with 'call to actions' and internal links where appropriate, quickly directing them to relevant information on another page. For example, you can access the Sign Up page from the button in the home page. This saves repeating information, and helps keep the website clean and concise.

### Navigation Bar

* Each page will have the navbar along the top, allowing the user to easily navigate to the different pages. The navbar appears as a horizontal list on desktop, while on mobile the logo/title is above a horizontal navbar list.

### Buttons

* There are two butttons across the site and they are consistent in design. 
* Buttons change colour when hovered over. The button text is legible both in its normal and hover state.
* I have used Bootstrap Button classes.

### Footer

* The Footer includes the social media links for the website.
* Social media links open in a new page.
* The Footer remains consistent on all pages.

# Features

## Current Features

### Responsive on all device sizes
- By using mobile first design I have created a website that is fully responsive on all screen sizes.
- I have used the Bootstrap grid system and Flex classes to adjust the layout based on the device screen size. This allows the images and texts to look good and be easy to read.

### Interactive elements
- When you hover over the restaurant names they change colour and become underlined, encouraging users to click on them.
- CSS transitions have been used on the navbar, buttons and social media icons.

## Future Features

### Events
- There is an events section with times and days, allowing users to see what is on and when. In future this could be expanded into a full page listing times, dates and upcoming events.

### Past/Upcoming Events
- There could be an archive of past or upcoming events.

### E-Commerce
- There could be an online booking service, allowing users to book directly through the site instead of being redirected to the others.

### Expantion
- The website could evolve from just advitising restuarants to other activities and businesses in the area. From sport, to wildlife excursions and live music.
